                <h3>Tonya Kucherovskaya</h3>
                <p>Graduated from 2015, National University of Bioresources
                    and natural history of Ukraine</p>
                <p>In a short time with Elena, I mastered grammar and replenished my completely empty vocabulary. From the first
                    lesson I realized that I was on my plate. Elena and I became friends because she was really worried about my success.
                    She became an authority for me, but I did not tremble in class, fearing to make the slightest mistake. Now I can brag
                    that I'm student ..</p>
